|  One ring to rule them all  |There's one for the sorrow|      Roll on, Titanic, roll       |   |   |   |
|    One ring to find them    |   And two for the joy    |You're the pride of White Star Line|   |   |   |
| One ring to bring them all  | And three for the girls  |      Roll on, Titanic, roll       |   |   |   |
|And in the darkness bind them|  And four for the boys   |      Into the mists of time       |   |   |   |
